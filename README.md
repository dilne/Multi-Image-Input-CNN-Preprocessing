Sometimes, you want multiple images as input to a CNN. This notebook contains easy to use code for preprocessing your images for multi-image input for a CNN. Just configure the "Variables for editing" section and run. This notebook will also provide a detailed walkthrough of what you need to know when using multiple images as input to a CNN.

The simplest way to use multiple images as input to a CNN is to merge their channels. In this example, we have two images of a cat and two images of a dog. The two cat images are of the same cat taken from the front and side and the dog images are of the same dog taken from the front and side. Each image has a width, height, and channels.
